# Star Wars Duel!

In this RPG-style game, players choose a character from the Star Wars universe as their fighter. The goal is to defeat all other opponents. Choose wisely; once your character is defeated, game over!

Once you choose a fighter, the remaining characters become your enemy. Pick an enemy character to begin a duel with them. Each character has a different amount of health and attack strength. No health will regenerate, so be careful!

When you choose your opponent, the duel starts. Press the 'attack' button to start attacking. Your damage and your opponent's damage done will appear below your opponent. If you win, choose your next opponent and battle again. You must defeat all opponents to become the Star Wars Duel Master!

Win or lose, you have the option to restart the game. But watch out: character health is different on restart. Your winning character may not get the job done the second time, or the opponent you fell against won't be as strong.

Have fun!
